### Chilisa Shorten
#### Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey 

- Geologist and data scientist with more than seven years of experience in quantitative research using a variety of data types (e.g. field, laboratory, big data) and analytical methods (e.g. thermal modeling, linear and stochastic models, machine learning algorithms). 

- My postdoc ends in September 2021 and <b>I’m currently seeking opportunities</b>. 
  - I’m interested in data scientist positions.
  - I hope to continue integrating data science and machine learning techniques to solve physical scientific research.

- Much of my research contains proprietary data but I’m working to increase my footprint on GitHub. 
- I have experience in the following processes applied to geologic oil and gas well and production data: 
  - data processing
  - imputation
  - visualization
  - statistical summaries
  - linear regression
  - spatial clustering
